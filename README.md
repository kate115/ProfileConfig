### Introduction

Hi friend! My name is kate115, sorry, but I am not telling you my real name. Iâ€™m interested in many things, including coding, games, reading, writing, music, and many more! Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript in the Microsoft course. When it comes to bugs or me getting confused in Github, I let my dad know and we solve it together. My hobby is writing and I do it both on paper and in Google Docs or Word. In other words, online or offline. 

### What I'm working on

- My README
- Rabbits
- The Microsoft coding course
